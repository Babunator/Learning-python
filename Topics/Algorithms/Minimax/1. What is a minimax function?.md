# Definition:

Minimax is a type of adversarial search algorithm for generating and exploring game trees.
It is mostly used to solve 2 Player zero-sum games (meaning where one side’s gain is equivalent to other side’s loss, so adding all gains and subtracting all losses end up being zero).
Game examples: Tic-Tac-Toe, Chess, Go, etc.\
\
A backtracking algorithm is being used to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that your opponent also plays optimally.
The Minimax algorithm keeps playing the turns of both player and the opponent  until it reaches a terminal state resulting in a draw, a win, or a loss.\
In Minimax the two players are called maximizer and minimizer. The maximizer tries to get the highest score possible while the minimizer tries to do the opposite and get the lowest score possible.\
\
The example below shows a game tree with 4 final states (leaf notes) and paths to reach final state:\

Since this is a backtracking based algorithm, it tries all possible moves, then backtracks and makes a decision.
- On the minimizers turn: Left side it has the choice between 3 and 5, therefore it picks 3. Right side it has the choice between 2 and 9, therefore it picks 2.
- On the maximizers turn: It can chose between left = 3 or right = 2. Therefore it goes left.

# How does it work? - Example Tic-Tac-Toe

The AI will recursively generate the game tree by exploring all possible moves for each board state and upon reaching a terminal state, we will assign a value of positive value for winning, negative value for losing and 0 for draw. Then based on these terminal states, for each explored turn either maximizer or minimizer will pick the most appropriate move.\

**Basicly:**
- Check whether the current state is terminal and return a score if it is. 
- If it’s not a terminal state:
1. for all possible moves, we make the move
2. switch players
3. call minimax with the *new* board state (if not terminal state loop to step 1 again)
4.  add its return value to a list of scores 
5.  and undo the move.
- After exhausting all possible moves, we will either return the maximum or minimum of our scores list, depending on whether we’re maximizing or minimizing.

**Pseudo-code:**
```
function minimax(board, depth, isMaximizingPlayer):

    if current board state is a terminal state :
        return value of the board
    
    if isMaximizingPlayer :
        bestVal = -INFINITY 
        for each move in board :
            value = minimax(board, depth+1, false)
            bestVal = max( bestVal, value) 
        return bestVal

    else :
        bestVal = +INFINITY 
        for each move in board :
            value = minimax(board, depth+1, true)
            bestVal = min( bestVal, value) 
        return bestVal 
 ```
