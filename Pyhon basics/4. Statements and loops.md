## Iteration Control Structures
### Checking conditions with and / or
- Use the and operator to check if both conditions are True at the same time.
- Use the or operator to check if at least one condition is True.

### For Loops 
* the for statement can be used to iterate over the members of a collection, so long as the collection is a sequence. 
* A common use of the for statement is to implement definite iteration over a range of values.
* version of this iteration structure is used to process each character of a string or elements in a list or dictionary (keys, values, items)
```Python3
for item in iterable_object:
    print(item)
# This is the syntax for loops in python
# Item represents the iterator's position
# You can call it anything you want
# printing numbers using for loops
for number in range(1,100):
    print(number)
# This will print numbers from 1 to 99
for letter in "Hello":
    print(letter)
# This for loop will print out the characters in the word hello
```
### While Loops
* The condition on the while statement is evaluated at the start of each repetition. If the condition is True, the body of the statement will execute.
```Python3
while some_condition:
    #do this
# An example 
user_input = None
while user_input != 'please':
    print('Sorry Access Denied')
```
* We need to be careful with while loops since they will continue forever if the condition is not true **It will ruin the program**

```Python3
#Another While Loop Example
num = 0
while num < 10:
    num +=1
    print(num)
```

#### Ranges
* They are usually used with for loops
* range(7) if we give in one parameter this will only print out numbers 0 to 6 
* range(1,8) if we give in two parameters this will print out numbers 1 to 7 
* range(1,10,2) In this example the thir parameter is used to tell how many steps should be skipped and this will print odd numbers 
* range helps you generate the sequence of number its a python built in function

```Python3
x = input('How many times I have told you clean the room ')
y = int(x)
for time in range(y):
    print(f'{time}: Clean Your room')
# A simple example of loops
´´´

### Conditional block with if else (if elif)
- Selection statements allow programmers to ask questions and then, based on the result, perform different actions. 
```Python3
if n<0:
   print("Sorry, value is negative")
else:
   print(math.sqrt(n))
```
- Selection constructs can be nested so that the result of one question helps decide whether to ask the next.
- An alternative syntax for this type of nested selection uses the elif keyword. The else and the next if are combined so as to eliminate the need for additional nesting levels.

## Importance of Break keyword in Python
* It gives us the ability to get out of the loop
```Python3
while True:
    command = input('Type exit to get out of this')
    if command == 'exit':
        break


for x in range(1,10):
    if x == 3:
        break
```

## List comprehension
- A list comprehension allows you to easily create a list based on some processing or selection criteria.0
- For example, if we would like to create a list of the first 10 perfect squares, we could use a for statement:
```Python3
sqlist=[]
for x in range(1,11):
         sqlist.append(x*x)

>>> sqlist
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

```
Using a list comprehension, we can do this in one step as:
```Python3
sqlist=[x*x for x in range(1,11)]
>>> sqlist
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
```
