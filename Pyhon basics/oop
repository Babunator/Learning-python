# What is Object Oriented Programming
In simple words `OOP` is used to represent things that don't exist in a programming language such as a player, car, processor and etc.

We represent things using `classes` and `objects`.

## What is a Class
A `Class` is a blueprint for objects.It can contain methods (functions) and attributes.
An `instance` or `object` they are constructed from a class blueprint that contains their class methods and properties.
